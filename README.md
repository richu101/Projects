## Food Delivery Drone

It is a Drone that  takes off and flies straight to its destination, following the path we set for it. It's powered by the APM Flight controller and guided by mission planner software. What's more, it's equipped with a special box that opens up at the designated location to deliver its payload of food.
 


## Hydrophonis

This is a test project that we implemented in our college. We set up a small semi-automatic hydroponics farm in our college. In this farm, we automatically identify the EC (Electrical Conductivity), pH, temperature of the nutrient solution, temperature, and humidity in the room. It is monitored and uploaded to the cloud. This is done using an EDGE Control board by Arduino, and the Wi-Fi communication is done by the MKR Wi-Fi 1010 board. The data is displayed on an app using the Arduino IoT Cloud platform.
